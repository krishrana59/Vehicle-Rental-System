📘 Project Title

Vehicle Rental System

🧠 Introduction

The Vehicle Rental System is a console-based mini project written in C++.
It allows users to add vehicles, rent or return them, and view availability.
The project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and inheritance in a simple and real-world application.

🎯 Objectives

To implement OOP concepts using C++ in a practical project.

To automate vehicle rental operations like booking and returning.

To calculate and track the availability of vehicles.

To design a simple and interactive console-based menu system.

⚙️ Working Process (Short)

The program starts with a menu showing five options — Add Vehicle, Display Vehicles, Rent Vehicle, Return Vehicle, and Exit.

When the user adds a vehicle, details like ID, name, and rate are entered and stored.

Display Vehicles shows all added vehicles along with their availability status.

Rent Vehicle changes a vehicle’s status to “Not Available.”

Return Vehicle updates it back to “Available.”

The system keeps running until the user selects Exit.

🌟 Key Features

Add and display multiple vehicles.

Rent or return vehicles using their ID.

Tracks availability status in real-time.

Simple menu-driven interface.

Demonstrates OOP principles clearly.

🧩 OOP Concepts Used

Class & Object: Represent each vehicle as an object.

Encapsulation: Keeps vehicle details within the class.

Inheritance: Can be extended for different vehicle types like Car, Bike, etc.

Abstraction: Simplifies complex operations through methods.

💻 How to Run the Program

Open any C++ compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Turbo C++, or an online compiler).

Copy and paste the program code into a new file named vehicle_rental.cpp.

Compile the program (press F9 in Code::Blocks or use g++ vehicle_rental.cpp -o rental in terminal).

Run the executable file.

Follow the on-screen menu to test the features.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add file handling to save and load vehicle data permanently.

Implement bill calculation based on rental days.

Add user login and registration system.

Provide discounts or reports for frequent customers.
